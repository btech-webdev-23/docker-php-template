Docker environment for PHP, MariaDB, and phpMyAdmin.

## Setup

To start setting up the environment, follow the below instructions.

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com)
2. Download [this repository](https://github.com/btech-webdev-23/granny) to your Documents folder (or somewhere memorable)

## Usage

To start the PHP server, follow the instructions below.

1. Open the Docker Desktop app
2. Double-click on `start_server.sh` to run the PHP server
3. If double-clicking on it opened the file in a text editor, do the following instead:
    1. (Windows) Right-click on `start_server.sh` and select Open With->Powershell
    2. (Mac/Linux) Right-click on `start_server.sh` and select Open With->Terminal.app
    3. If neither of those work, open either Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Powershell (Windows) and paste the command `docker-compose up` and then press Enter to start the server
